Sharpe Ratio
Sharpe Ratio is a risk to reward ratio, it measures portfolio returns generated in excess
to the investment in risk-free asset, for per unit of total risk taken. While, positive Sharpe
ratio indicates, portfolio compensating investors with excess returns (over risk-free rate)
for the commensurate risk taken; negative Sharpe ratio indicates, investors are better off
investing in risk-free assets.
Beta
Beta (ß) of a portfolio is a number indicating the relation between portfolio returns with
that of the market index i.e. it measure the volatility, or systematic risk, of a portfolio in
comparison to the market as a whole.
Standard Deviation
A statistical measure that defines expected volatility/risk associated with a portfolio.
This explains the variation/deviation from the average returns delivered by the portfolio.
A higher standard deviation means higher volatility (risk) and a lower standard deviation
means lower volatility.
Risk Free Return
The theoretical rate of return of an investment with safest (zero risk) investment in a country.
4 Indexation Benefit
l Long Term Capital Gains (holding period of over 3 years) from Debt Mutual Funds are
  taxed at 20% plus applicable surcharge and cess with the benefit of indexation.
l Government notifies Cost Inflation Index (CII) for each financial year taking into
  consideration the prevailing inflation levels.
l The cost of acquistion for computation of tax is adjusted for inflation using CII,
  thereby reducing the capital gains from tax perspective.
l An investment made into a debt fund towards the end of a financial year (say, in
  March 2020) and held for a little over 3 years (say, in April 2023) would be eligible for
  application of CII over 5 financial years, resulting in 4 indexation benefit.


Total Expense Ratio
Total expenses charged to scheme for the month expressed as a percentage to average
monthly net assets.
Tracking Error
Tracking error indicates how closely the portfolio return is tracking the benchmark Index
return. It measures the deviation between portfolio return and benchmark index return. A
lower tracking error indicates portfolio closely tracking benchmark index and higher tracking
error indicates portfolio returns with higher deviation from benchmark index returns.
Residual Maturity
Weighted Residual Maturity of the securities in scheme.
Portfolio Yield (Yield To Maturity)
Weighted average yield of the securities in scheme portfolio.

Portfolio Turnover Ratio
Portfolio Turnover Ratio is the percentage of a fund’s holdings that have changed in a given
year. This ratio measures the fund’s trading activity, which is computed by taking the lesser
of purchases or sales and dividing by average monthly net assets.
Modified Duration
A formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response
to a change in interest rates. Modified duration of portfolio can be used to anticipate the
change in market value of portfolio for every change in portfolio yield.
Macaulay Duration (Duration)
Macaulay Duration (Duration) measures the price volatility of fixed income securities. It is
often used in the comparison of interest rate risk between securities with different coupons
and different maturities. It is defined as the weighted average time to cash flows of a bond
where the weights are nothing but the present value of the cash flows themselves. It is
expressed in years/days. The duration of a fixed income security is always shorter than its
term to maturity, except in the case of zero coupon securities where they are the same.

      While the fiscal deficit in first 2 months is low, it is likely to normalise in the coming
months. More importantly, in view of incumbent government winning the election with
a lower majority than last time, one should watch out for FY25 full budget (likely to
be presented in July 2024) for medium term direction of fiscal policy. Significantly
higher than expected RBI dividend of INR 2.1 trillion (~0.7% of GDP) can provide the
government with some flexibility to increase spending and simultaneously adhering to
its fiscal consolidation path.
      Retail inflation stable, likely to ease in coming quarters: India’s May CPI eased
marginally relative to the month before. Food inflation continued to remain the primary
contributor of CPI led by elevated prices of vegetables, pulses, cereals, spices, and sugar.
Core CPI trended lower driven by benign input price pressure and modest increase in
inflation of housing goods and services, health, clothing and footwear, and recreation
and amusement items. All other major components of CPI were largely similar to last
month on YOY basis.

      CPI is expected to decline over the coming quarters aided by favorable base effects,
benign input price pressure, arrival of new crops easing food inflation and sluggish
core CPI momentum.
      Trade Deficit rises, likely to remain rangebound: Trade deficit widened month
on month in May 2024 largely in line with the seasonal trend. The increase was driven
by increase in net oil imports and NONG imports. NONG imports increased driven
by higher import of transport equipment, machinery and non-ferrous metals. This was
partially offset by rise in exports of engineering and electronic goods.

Trade deficit is likely to remain in similar range in the coming quarters as the oil
prices remain range bound. Rise in commodity prices in recent months poses a risk
of deficit widening.
Commodity prices: Most industrial commodity prices declined during the month as
global growth momentum remained subdued. However, Brent crude oil prices increased
during the month as US inventories declined more than expected.

Summary                  and Conclusion

      Global economic activity momentum has moderated in Q2CY24 after a strong
Q1CY24. While outlook on growth remains uncertain, it is expected to remain within
a range in the coming quarters. This is driven by expectations of labour market in the
US to remain resilient and additional policy support by China to support growth. Recent
surge in international shipping freight rate can put upward pressure on input prices.

India's growth trajectory remains stable, supported by buoyant industrial and service
sectors. While some slowdown is visible in consumption and outlook on rural con-
sumption remains uncertain, it could be partly due to elections related uncertainty.
Investments remains supported by real estate activity, government and improvement
in organised private corporate capex. Private corporate sectors capital expenditure
has potential to grow faster in view of low leverage, increasing capacity utilization,
consistent corporate profitability, and a robust banking sector balance sheet. India’s
external sector remains robust on the back of comfortable current account deficit and
adequate forex reserves. Significant rise in geopolitical tension disrupting supply chains,
acceleration in monetary policy tightening, potential slowdown in pace of domestic
reforms due to coalition government, etc. are key near-term risks.

Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for India's economy appears promising. This
optimism is fuelled by favourable government policies, benefits from Production-Linked
Incentive schemes, opportunities arising from shift in the global supply chain, enhanced
infrastructure investments, the potential of resurgence in private sector capex, and the
enduring robustness of consumption.


Equity Market Update

      During the month, both the Nifty and BSE Sensex ended ~6.5-7% higher compared
to the end of May 2024. The midcap and small index returns surpassed the large-cap
benchmarks. The equity markets corrected sharply on the day of general election
results (June 4) as margin of victory of incumbent government narrowed. However,
it rebounded subsequently and surpassed its previous highs on expectations of policy
continuity and political stability. Key events and factors which influenced the market
during the month include - US FOMC scaling back rate cut expectations to one from
three before, announcement of MSPs for Kharif crops, RBI maintaining policy status
quo, etc. Sector performance was strong with IT, Auto, Banking, Healthcare and FMCG
being the key outperformers.

      Global market performance was mixed. Equity markets in the US, Japan and Korea
were the major gainers while Europe, China, and Hong Kong equities declined. Below
are detailed tables outlining the performance of key domestic and global indices.:

Outlook
      As on June 30, 2024, NIFTY 50 was trading at ~22x FY25E price to earnings mul-
tiple. Further, Market cap-to-GDP stood ~132% (based on CY24 GDP estimates) and
the gap between 10Y G-sec yield and 1Y-Forward NIFTY 50 earnings yield* remains at
elevated level [*Earnings yield = 1/ (one year forward P/E)]. In general, current valua-
tion indicators are at a premium to their historical averages. However, one should view
these valuations in the context of structurally attractive nominal GDP growth, a healthy
corporate earnings outlook and robust de-levered corporate and banking balance sheets.

^to Long term (LT) average, @-Price to Book value.
 The correction following the recent general election outcome was more than offset by
the robust bounce back in the following weeks led by net buying by both FPIs and DIIs.
The growing retail participation in the equity markets has also resulted in liquidity and
depth improvement of equity markets. The rally over the past year and half has been
broad and small cap and mid cap indices have significantly outperformed. They now
trade at a noteworthy premium to their long-term average valuation. Given the aggre-
gate valuation being higher than historical average, the importance of stock selection
increases even more.

•    Robust credit growth and elevated SLR holdings can keep the incremental demand
     for G-Secs from banks subdued.
•    Rise in commodity prices driven by escalation of geopolitical tensions and / or
     buoyant economic activity in China.
Overall, in our view, yields are likely to trade with a downward bias and the long end
of the yield curve is likely to outperform over the medium term. Thus, as highlighted
in  past, for investors with a relatively longer investment horizon, it is a good time
to increase allocation to longer duration funds in line with individual risk appetite.
Further, given a flat yield curve and elevated short-term rates along with expectations
of rate cuts in FY25, one may also consider investment in short or medium duration
categories of debt funds.

 Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). For performance of other schemes managed by Roshi Jain, please
 refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the
 Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. As NIFTY 50 TRI data is not available
 since inception of the scheme, additional benchmark performance is calculated using composite CAGR of NIFTY 50 PRI values from January 1,
 1995 to June 29, 1999 and TRI values since June 30, 1999. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns.

 Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. The Scheme, formerly a large cap fund, has
 undergone change in Fundamental attributes and become a Large and Mid-cap Fund. Accordingly, the Scheme’s benchmark has also
 changed. Hence, the past performance of the Scheme may not strictly be comparable with that of the new benchmark.
 As BSE SENSEX TRI data is not available since inception of the scheme, additional benchmark performance is calculated using composite
 CAGR of BSE SENSEX PRI values from February 18, 1994 to August 18, 1996 and TRI values since August 19, 1996. $$ All Distributions
 declared prior to the splitting of the Scheme into IDCW & Growth Options are assumed to be reinvested in the units of the Scheme at the
 then prevailing NAV (ex-distribution NAV). For performance of other schemes managed by Gopal Agrawal, please refer page 104. Different
 plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower
 to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

 ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
 consideration for computation of performance.

                  comparable with that of its Additional Benchmark in view of balanced nature of the scheme where a portion of scheme’s investments are
                  made in debt instruments. $$ All Distributions declared prior to the splitting of the Scheme into IDCW & Growth Options are assumed to
                  be reinvested in the units of the Scheme at the then prevailing NAV (ex-distribution NAV). For performance of other schemes managed
                  by Gopal Agrawal, Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Arun Agarwal, Nirman Morakhia and Anil Bamboli, please refer page 104. Different plans viz.
                  Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the
                  extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. As NIFTY 50 TRI data is not available since inception of the
                  scheme, additional benchmark performance is calculated using composite CAGR of NIFTY 50 PRI values from February 1, 1994 to June 29,
                  1999 and TRI values since June 30, 1999. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.
                  ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns.
                  Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance.

                  This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate
                  instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an
                  order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
                  due diligence when deciding to make their investments.
                 Note: @@Effective close of business hours of June 1, 2018, HDFC Prudence Fund merged with HDFC Growth Fund (HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund after changes in fundamental attributes). As the
                 portfolio characteristics and the broad investment strategy of HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund is similar to that of erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund, the track record (i.e. since inception date, dividend
                 history, etc.) and past performance of erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund has been considered, in line with SEBI circular on Performance disclosure post consolidation/ merger of scheme dated April 12, 2018.

This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate
instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an
order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments.
Note: @@ Effective close of business hours of June 1, 2018, HDFC Balanced Fund merged with HDFC Premier Multi Cap Fund (HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund after changes in fundamental attributes). As the portfolio
characteristics and the broad investment strategy of HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund is similar to that of erstwhile HDFC Balanced Fund, the track record (i.e. since inception date, dividend history, etc) and past
performance of erstwhile HDFC Balanced Fund has been considered, in line with SEBI circular on Performance disclosure post consolidation/ merger of scheme dated April 12, 2018.

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. The Scheme formerly, a debt oriented hybrid fund,
has undergone change in Fundamental attributes and become a multi asset fund investing in equities, debt and gold
related instruments. Accordingly, the Scheme’s benchmark has also changed. Hence, the performance of the Scheme from inception till May
22, 2018 may not strictly be comparable with those of the new benchmark and the additional benchmark. Scheme performance may not
strictly be comparable with that of its Additional Benchmark in view of hybrid nature of the scheme where a portion of scheme’s investments
are made in debt instruments and gold related instruments. For performance of other schemes managed by Srinivasan Ramamurthy,
Anil Bamboli, Bhagyesh Kagalkar, Arun Agarwal and Nirman Morakhia please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct
Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

^^Effective December 16, 2015, certain changes, including changes to fundamental attributes, were effected in the erstwhile HDFC Multiple
Yield Fund, (an open ended income scheme) which was renamed as HDFC Equity Savings Fund, an open ended equity scheme. On account
of these changes, the performance during the period(s) from September 17, 2004 to December 15, 2015 is not comparable.
Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. Scheme performance may not strictly be
comparable with that of its Additional Benchmark, since a portion of scheme’s investments are made in debt instruments. For performance
of other schemes managed by Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Anil Bamboli, Arun Agarwal and Nirman Morakhia, please refer page 104. Different
plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower
to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

                                                                                                       ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into

                                                                                                       interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely

                                                                                                       greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted

 Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Scheme performance may not strictly be comparable with that of
 its Additional Benchmark in view of hybrid nature of the scheme where a portion of scheme’s investments are made in equity instruments.
 For performance of other schemes managed by Srinivasan Ramamurthy and Shobhit Mehrotra, please refer page 104. Different plans
 viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to
 the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

 Note: Effective close of business hours of May 25, 2018, HDFC MF Monthly Income Plan – Long Term Plan (MIP-LTP) underwent changes in
 Fundamental Attributes and was renamed as HDFC Hybrid Debt Fund (HHDF) and HDFC MF Monthly Income Plan – Short Term Plan was
 merged therein. As the portfolio structuring of HHDF closely resembles the erstwhile MIP-LTP, the past performance of MIP-LTP is provided,

  ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
  consideration for computation of performance.
 This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
 interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely
 to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order
 greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted
 portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

 Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). $$ All Distributions declared prior to the splitting of the Scheme into IDCW
 & Growth Options are assumed to be reinvested in the units of the Scheme at the then prevailing NAV (ex-distribution NAV). For performance of
 other schemes managed by Roshi Jain, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure.
 The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular
 Plan. As TRI data is not available since inception of the scheme, additional benchmark performance is calculated using composite CAGR of NIFTY
 50 PRI values from Mar 29, 96 (Data for March 31, 96 is not available) to Jun 29, 99 and TRI values since Jun 30, 99. As NIFTY 500 TRI data is
 not available for March 31, 96, benchmark performance is calculated from March 29, 96. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into consideration
for computation of performance.

Returns less than 1 year period are simple annualized and greater than 1 year are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. For
performance of other schemes managed by Anupam Joshi and Swapnil Jangam, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and
Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns.                                           Load is not taken into
consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater

  Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. For performance of other schemes managed by
  Anupam Joshi and Praveen Jain, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure.
  The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular
  Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

  ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
  consideration for computation of performance.

  This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
  interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
  lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
  than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
  maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

                   refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the
                   Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan,
                   refer page 109 to 115.

                   ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns.                                       Load is not taken into
                   consideration for computation of performance.

                   This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
                   interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
                   lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
                   than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
                   maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. For performance of other schemes managed by
Shobhit Mehrotra, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses
of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For
Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

performance of other schemes managed by Shobhit Mehrotra & Vikash Agarwal, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and
Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns.                                          Load is not taken into
consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument
or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than
what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when
deciding to make their investments.

 16.19      This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
82.64       interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
  0.26      lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
            than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
  0.91      maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance.
For performance of other schemes managed by Shobhit Mehrotra, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan
have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses
/ commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.
 ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
 consideration for computation of performance.

             This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to
             the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives
             is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be

 Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. For performance of other schemes managed by Anil
 Bamboli, please refer page 104. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct
 Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of
 Direct Plan, refer page 109 to 115.

 ^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken into
 consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the
interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be
lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater
than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio
maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments.

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended
schemes is primarily buy-and-hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed.
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR).
Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended
schemes is primarily buy-and-hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed.
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR).
Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available

    formerly a large cap fund, has undergone change in Fundamental attributes and become a Large and
    Mid-cap Fund. Accordingly, the Scheme’s benchmark has also changed. Hence, the past performance
    of the Scheme may not strictly be comparable with that of the new benchmark.

Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR).
Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended
schemes is primarily buy-and-hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed.

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended
schemes is primarily buy-and-hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed.
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Different
plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses /
commission charged in the Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available

                           Each asset class behaves differently across different economic cycles. As Asset class
                           winners keep changing, asset allocation is critical for wealth creation. HDFC Multi-Asset
                           Fund (“the Scheme”), which invests in 3 asset classes viz. Equity, Debt and Gold, aims to
                           meet asset allocation needs of investors in a dynamic way.
                           The current investment strategy is subject to change depending on the market conditions. For complete portfolio, please
